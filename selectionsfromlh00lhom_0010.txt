vi PREFACE.

With the exception of a few points, the text consol-ms to
that of Holzer’s loth edition (Stuttgart, 1889). Lewis’s Ele-
mentary Latin Dictiomtrgs has been followed closely in spelling,
word division, and the parts os verbs. The “ hidden '⁹ quanti-
ties, however, are marked according to Marx (Ηῐζίὲόϋσῆἶεῑη,
‘2d ed.)‚ already used in other books os this series.
