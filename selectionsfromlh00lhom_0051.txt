GNAEUS POMPEIUS MAGNUS. 39

PAGE 2. 2. ei . . . taedio ε see references on Sullae auxilia,
p. 1, l. 18 . The litera] translation would be: “ no coil was sor a

weariness co him.'' Avoid the use of un-English expressions, and
render this: “ no coil weccrz‘ed him.''

3. cibi v1n1que2 A. 218, b; B.204, 1, a; G. 3753 H. 399, 11.

5. saltu . . . cursu . . . luctand6: abl. of respect or means.
Jumping, running, wrestling, together with throwing the J'avelin
and the discus, were the common gymnastic exercises for both
amateur and professional athleteS.

8. Quem ubi = et ubi eum: “And when (Sulla heard) chat
he.'’ See note on Quae reS, p. 1, 1. 6. The accusative is the sub-
ject of accedere: A. 336, 2 ; Β. 314 3 G. 6503 H. 523, Ι.

10. imperfitfirem: military authority (imperium) could, strictly
speaking, be conferred only by a special law. It became customary,
however, to use the word impertitor as a title of honor. Soldiers
sometimes bestowed it on their general after a successful battle.
Julius Caesar and nearly all of his successors prefixed it to their
names ; hence the title of emperor.

11. ei' venienti: the indirect obJ'ect of adsumere. For the
translation see note on cenanti, p. 1, l. 7. —sellaz abl. of separa-
tion ; the preposition is often omitted. Cf. tentorio, p. 1, l. 10;
ex equo and equ& in this sentence.

15. occupatam: do not try to retain the form of the Latin
expression. Translate: “from Carbo, who had seized z't.’'

21. decrevisset : from decerne. For mood see note on ηᾶηιὶᾶῐα
esset, p. 1, l. 6.

22. adversita fuisset: the longer forms of the auxiliary sum
are frequently used in late Latin authors with the same meaning
as the shorter: fuisset: esset. For the subjunctive moed see
A. 320, e; G. 626, R.; H. 517. From the use of sibi it may
be seen that the clause expresses also the thought or words of
Pompey. — eum facturum: sc. esse. For the infinitive see note
on Quem ubi, l. 8. The direct form might be either (a) “iniqui
facies, ,ςῖ 1)ᾶ7ιὶἑ3,” or (b) “ iniquefacikis, εἶ ρᾶηίᾶε.” Notice that
the main clause (conclusion) in either case changes to the future
infinitive ; the subordinate clause (condition) becomes subjunctive
