PREFAOE.

TOWARD the end of the first year of the preparatory course
in Latin there is often felt a need of a limited amount of text
simple enough to fill the gap between the beginners’ book and
the work of the second year. Such a need this book under-
takes to fill. It does not aim to compete with the admirable
editions of the same text recently made for those who can
afford to devote more than a few weeks to reading matter of
this kind. The four biographies selected comprise about thirty
pages, or the equivalent of a book of Caesar-'s Gallio Hiar,—
the amount recommended by several committees which have
recently considered the subject of preparatory work in Latin.

At this stage of his progress it is assumed that the pupil has
mastered the ordinary forms and simpler constructions of the
lan guage, but still needs muc‘h detailed instructions on the more
difficult points. References to the grammars most widely used
have been freely given, and whenever it seemed necessary or
convenient grammatical inforlnation has been incorporated 111
the notes. While the editor cannot endorse the dictum that
such material should be called to a pupil’s attention only when
he mistranslates the text, he feels sure no reasonable teacher
will require a pupil to master all the principles referred to.
At any rate, no pupil will do so, and his attention should,

therefore, be directed especially to those which he most needs.
